# Description

The BMI (Body Mass Index) Calculator is a Java Swing application that helps users assess their body mass index based on their height in feet and inches, as well as their weight in kilograms. The application provides a quick way to determine whether a person is underweight, normal weight, at risk, or falls into one of the obese categories. It also displays the BMI value along with a color-coded category label for easy interpretation.
